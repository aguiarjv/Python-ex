## Required code from the Dev330x Introduction to Python Unit 3

NASA maintains a website that displays a different astronomy picture every day at https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/.

The program will be run from the terminal and will be capable of:
*Downloading today's image
*Downloading an image of a specified date
*Downloading a surprise image for a randomly generated date (between June 16 1995 and today)

Then it will create folders (year/month) to store the image
